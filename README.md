# wAIfu

After I recently started a job that required me to use natural language processing as one of the main tools, 
I became intrigued in the area of NLP and such.
And I decided I want to make an wAIfu chatbot using NLP and reinforcement learning -- both of which I 
am not as experienced in -- because... it sounds fun(RIP to my AnimefaceGAN, I guess I'll work on that
later).
